# Compiler_parser

This project provides a tool to transform a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG) into a normalized form suitable for Recursive Descent Parsing. The tool removes left recursion and performs left factoring, constructs an LL(1) parsing table, and generates a parsing tree for a given input string.
you can give your own grammar by changing the input_grammar variable.
